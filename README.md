# FMP 2024: scRNA-seq Analysis of Skin Inflammatory Diseases

## Overview

This project analyzes single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from 23 skin biopsies of patients with pustular psoriasis (PSO), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), and palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). Key findings include differences in cell type composition, with B cells and neutrophils showing distinct patterns, and the identification of pathways like TGFÎ²1, potentially driving disease progression. The IL-36 cytokine family exhibited disease-specific expression.
